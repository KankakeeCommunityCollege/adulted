### What is your favorite memory of KCC?

Labs for Microbiology and Anatomy and Physiology classes. Playing euchre in the student center.

### Did you have a favorite instructor at KCC?

Not an instructor, but a guidance counselor: Don James.

### How did KCC help pave the path to where you are today?

I am very fortunate to have had access to Kankakee Community College.  When I was in high school, I applied to, visited, and was accepted by four-year universities.  When I graduated, though, I wasn’t ready to go away to school.  Fortunately, KCC was there.  At the time, not many people I knew was going to KCC.  That turned out to be a good thing, though, because I met new people and made new friends.  I was also able to live at home and work while attending school.  Thanks to the help from a wonderful guidance counselor, Mr. Don James, I received a community college transfer scholarship, which provided full tuition, fees, books, and a mileage stipend to Governors State University, where I completed my bachelor’s degree.

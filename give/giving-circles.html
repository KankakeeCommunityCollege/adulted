          <h3>President's Circle</h3>
          <p>KCC’s President’s Circle recognizes donors who have contributed annual gifts of $1,000 or more. These gifts--in the form of annual donations, endowed scholarships, planned endowments and support for the college’s capital development--make a lasting impact for KCC students.</p>
          <p>President’s Circle donors receive exclusive correspondence from KCC President Dr. John Avendano and are offered an inside look into the impact our faculty, students and alumni make through stories and outreach opportunities. Donors also receive recognition in publications and invitations to events.</p>
          <p>Gifts from President’s Circle members have the power to transform the college experience for KCC students in a positive, lasting way. Gifts can be directed where they will make the most impact or can be tailored for specific interests.</p>

          <h3>Women's Giving Circle</h3>
          <p>“Educate, Empower, Endeavor” is the Women’s Giving Circle campaign to raise $100,000. The goal of the campaign is to help students who face unexpected challenges that interrupt their ability to complete their certificate or degree.</p>
          <p>[EMBED VIDEO]</p>
          <p>This initiative provides support such as child care, increased access to technology and help following the loss of job or other life changes that prevent completion of college.</p>
          <h3>Why Should I Help?</h3>
          <p>Because your gift can transform lives:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your support will <strong>educate</strong> students who face barriers to achieving a certificate or degree</li>
            <li>Your investment in students <strong>empowers</strong> them to be successful</li>
            <li>Your gift creates a path for students to <strong>endeavor</strong> to achieve more and enhance our community</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Of KCC students, 60 percent are female, and their average age is 31. Many of these women balance family and work with attending college part-time. After being away from the classroom for so long, they face challenges such as regaining confidence in their abilities, finding resources and overcoming anxieties. In the end, when a woman advances her life, it makes a difference for her, her children and the entire community.</p>
          <h3>How Will the Funds Be Used?</h3>
          <p>Once the Women's Giving Circle fund reached $20,000, it began distributing grants to students who were referred by a faculty member. Potential student needs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Childcare/eldercare</li>
            <li>Family crisis</li>
            <li>Technology</li>
            <li>Medical emergencies</li>
            <li>Books</li>
            <li>Tuition</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All grant requests are reviewed by the Office of Financial Aid and the Office of the Registrar to ensure that students have no other means of assistance and are in good academic and behavioral standing.</p>

          <p>The decision of where to contribute certainly is a personal one. Your gift to the KCC Foundation helps further the mission we all work toward: Enhancing quality of life though learning.</p>
          <p>A successful employee giving campaign provides a strong case for other donors to support KCC. Contributions from employees demonstrate that those closest to the college believe in its mission and are willing to support it financially. This makes our appeals to corporate partners, community members and alumni so much more effective.</p>

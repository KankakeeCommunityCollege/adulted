          <h3>Because your gift can transform lives</h3>
          <p>The decision of where to contribute certainly is a personal one. Your gift to the KCC Foundation helps further the mission we all work toward: Enhancing quality of life though learning.</p>
          <p>A successful employee giving campaign provides a strong case for other donors to support KCC. Contributions from employees demonstrate that those closest to the college believe in its mission and are willing to support it financially. This makes our appeals to corporate partners, community members and alumni so much more effective.</p>
          <p>DONATE NOW</p>

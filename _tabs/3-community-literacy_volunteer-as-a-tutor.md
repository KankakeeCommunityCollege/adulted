### Volunteers
{: .typography__h3 }

Volunteers are the backbone of Adult Literacy Initiative Volunteers Expanded (ALIVE) literacy programs. They are needed for the following assignments:

* Tutor adults in reading, writing, math and the English language.
* Serve as classroom tutors.
* Participate in the "Baby Talk" program for parents of newborns.

Tutor and student assignments are made based on availability of both the tutor and student. Sessions are held mornings, afternoons or evenings, every day of the week. Most tutors work with the learners 1-2 hours per week. Days off, vacations or breaks are determined by the tutor and student. Tutors are required to submit tutor hours monthly via email or mail.

#### ALIVE Training

All tutors must complete an application form and 12 hours of training. Online tutor training is available through the Illinois Adult Literacy Volunteer Tutor Training website. The training will take approximately 10 hours and the tutors will be able to complete it at their own pace. Upon completion, tutors will have a 2 hour orientation to the ALIVE Program. Additional training opportunities will take place twice per year.

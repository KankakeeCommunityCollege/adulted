            <p>Kankakee community college is the largest provider of high school equivalency, English as a second language (ESL), and other pre-college remedial services in the Kankakee and Iroquois County area.</p>
            <p>Programs and services available at KCC include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="{{ page.baseurl }}/programs/ged/">GED/High School Equivalency (HSE)</a></li>
              <li><a href="{{ page.baseurl }}/programs/esl/">English Second Language (ESL)</a></li>
              <li><a href="{{ page.baseurl }}/programs/community-literacy/">Community Literacy Project</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>To complete a high school equivalency in Illinois, there are now three recognized tests: <a href="https://ged.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GED</a>, <a href="https://hiset.ets.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>HiSet and Test Accessing Secondary Completion (TASC). The KCC Testing Center proctors the GED (computer-based only) and HiSet (computer-based and "paper/pencil" versions). Adult Education classes are based on skills and, therefore, prepare students to take all three tests.</p>
            <p>The Adult Education Learning System helps adults complete their high school educational requirements or improve their academic skills.</p>
            <p>Are you between 16 and 24 years old, want to earn your high school equivalency or looking  for better employment opportunities? You may be eligible for Young Adult Program Services.</p>

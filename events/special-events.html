          <p>In many cases, scholarships can be a deciding factor in a student’s ability to attend college.</p>
          <p>At the annual Scholarship Recognition Dinner, scholarship recipients and those who donated to their scholarship have the opportunity to meet. Recipients share their appreciation with donors and talk more about their plans for the future. Donors are able to see firsthand the impact their donations made and how their contributions transformed students’ lives.</p>
          <p>The event is held in October. The 2017 dinner was Thursday, Oct. 19, at the Hilton Garden Inn, Kankakee. The following scholarships and awards were announced:</p>

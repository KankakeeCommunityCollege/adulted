          <p>Established in 2009, the John M. Fulton Distinguished Alumni Award honors longtime KCC Alumni Association member John Fulton of Herscher. Fulton is a 1981 graduate of KCC and earned two associate degrees (business and general studies).</p>
          <p>Fulton is many things--a local farmer, a friend, a decorated Vietnam War hero, and a tireless advocate for veterans affairs and for people with disabilities. Most of all, he is a source of pride and inspiration for all of us at KCC.</p>
          <p>After Fulton was awarded KCC Foundation's Distinguished Alumni Award in 2009, the board voted unanimously to rename the honor "The John M. Fulton Distinguished Alumni Award."</p>

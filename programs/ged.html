            <p>In Illinois, there are three recognized high school equivalency tests: GED, HiSet and Test Accessing Secondary Completion (TASC). The KCC Testing Center proctors the GED (computer-based) and HiSet (computer-based and "paper/pencil") versions.</p>
            <p>KCC has instruction and services to help students succeed on high school equivalency tests. Classes are offered at no cost. New classes begin throughout the year at the KCC Riverfront Campus and the South Extension Center (Watseka).&nbsp;</p>

                  <p>To complete a high school equivalency in Illinois, there are now three recognized tests: GED, HiSet and Test Accessing Secondary Completion (TASC). The KCC Testing Center proctors the GED (computer-based only) and HiSet (computer-based and "paper/pencil" versions).</p>
                  <p>KCC has a comprehensive range of instruction and services to help students succeed on HSE tests. All HSE classes are offered at no cost to the public. New class sessions are offered throughout the year at several convenient locations. Students study at their own pace. Helpful and friendly teachers assist students.</p>
                  <p>Prior to entering Adult Education/High School Equivalency (HSE) classes , prospective students must first attend an orientation. Program orientations are offered regularly.</p>

              <h3 class="main-heading editable">About the GED Test</h3>
              <div class="editable">
                <p>The General Educational Development (GED) test allows adults to demonstrate that they have the knowledge and skills equivalent to a high school diploma. Having a GED provides many opportunities, especially in the job market, for those who did not graduate from high school. It also is a first step toward a college degree.</p>
              </div>
              <h3 class="main-heading editable">Computer-based GED testing</h3>
              <div class="editable">
                <p>A new computer-based version of the GED test was introduced on Jan. 2, 2014. Old and the new test modules cannot be combined. If you passed some of the GED tests prior to 2014 but did not complete the whole test, you will have to re-take the parts you’ve already passed.</p>
                <p>Preparing and registering for the test have changed, too:</p>
                <ul>

              </div>
              <h3 class="main-heading editable">Measures subject skills required by high schools</h3>
              <div class="editable">
                <p>The GED test has four-subject areas to measures skills required by high schools and requested by colleges and employers. The subjects are Science, Social Studies, Mathematical Reasoning, and Reasoning Through Language Arts. Tests are available in English and Spanish.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="https://ged.com/about_test/test_subjects/language_arts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reasoning through Language  Arts (RLA)</a> (150 minutes)</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The entire GED test (all four subjects) takes about 8 hours to complete. You can expect these types of questions:</p>
                <ul>

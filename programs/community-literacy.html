                <p>Adults, 16 years old and older, who need help with their literacy skills and who are not enrolled in school can join KCC's adult literacy program for individual, classroom and small group tutoring. KCC’s Adult Literacy Initiative Volunteers Expanded (ALIVE) program provides an opportunity for adults to become competent enough in the area of reading, writing, math and English language skills to function effectively in their everyday lives.</p>
                <p>ALIVE provides accessible, quality education in a caring environment by keeping the learner's needs at the center of decision-making. ALIVE partners with community service agencies throughout the college district.</p>

                <p>The Baby Talk Program introduces the importance of early literacy to parents of newborns at local hospitals. This program is a collaborative effort between Kankakee Community College, United Way of Kankakee County, Community Foundation of Kankakee River Valley, area hospitals, and trained volunteers.</p>
                <p>Parents are the key to a child’s success in learning to read.  Reading, singing and talking to babies stimulate brain growth.  Research shows that reading to babies every day from birth increases brain capacity for language and literacy skills.  It is the single most important thing you can do to prepare a child to read.</p>

                <p>Tutor and student assignments are made based on availability of both the tutor and student. Sessions are held mornings, afternoons or evenings, every day of the week. Most tutors work with the learners 1-2 hours per week. Days off, vacations or breaks are determined by the tutor and student. Tutors are required to submit tutor hours monthly via email or mail.</p>

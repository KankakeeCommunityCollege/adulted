          <p>The English as a Second Language (ESL) program assists those whose native language is not English. Classes help students improve their English language skills in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. There are five levels of classes to help students at every stage of learning.</p>
          <p>All ESL classes are provided at no cost to the student. Students may enroll any time a class is held. You can enroll several times throughout the year.</p>
